# setup-champs

Setup Champs is a platform to share and discover unique desk setups. Built for gamers, creators, and developers seeking inspiration and community. Users can browse, upload, like, and bookmark posts for later.

## Optimizations

If I had more time, I would add:

• Customizations to user profiles (e.g. bios).

• Comments to build better community interaction.

• Monthly leaderboards where users win prizes for most liked setup.

## How It’s Made

Frontend:

• EJS for templating

• SCSS for styling

• JavaScript for interactivity

Backend:

• Node.js + Express.js for server-side logic

• MongoDB + Mongoose for data storage

• Passport.js for user authentication
